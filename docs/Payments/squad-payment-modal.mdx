# Squad Payment Modal

### Payment Modal

Squad Payment Modal provides an easy and convenient payment flow. It is the simplest way to securely collect payments from your customers without them leaving your website. The customer will be shown all the payment methods you have selected.

It can be integrated with simple steps, by copying the code in the embedded section and pasting it on your page; making it the easiest way to accept payments. It works across devices and can help increase your conversion.

### Parameters

To initialize a transaction, you need to pass details such as email, first name, last name, amount, transaction reference, etc. Email, amount, and currency are **required**. You can also pass any other additional information in the _metadata_ object field. The following is a complete list of parameters that you can pass:

| PARAMETERS      | REQUIRED? | DESCRIPTION |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------
| key      | Yes      | Your Squad public key. Use the test key found in your [Sandbox account](https://sandbox.squadco.com/login) in test mode, and use the live key found in your [Squad dashboard](https://dashboard.squadco.com/login) in live mode.
| email   | Yes       | Customer's email address.
| amount   | Yes       | The amount you are debiting customer (expressed in the lowest currency value - **kobo** & **cent**). 
| transaction_ref   | No       | Unique case-sensitive transaction reference. If you do not pass this parameter, Squad will generate a unique reference for you.
| currency_code   | Yes       | The currency you want the amount to be charged in. Allowed value is **NGN** or **USD**.

function SquadPay() {
 
  const squadInstance = new squad({
    onClose: () => console.log("Widget closed"),
    onLoad: () => console.log("Widget loaded successfully"),
    onSuccess: () => console.log(`Linked successfully`),
    key: "test_pk_sample-public-key-1",
    //Change key (test_pk_sample-public-key-1) to the key on your Squad Dashboard
    email: document.getElementById("email-address").value,
    amount: document.getElementById("amount").value * 100,
    //Enter amount in Naira or Dollar (Base value Kobo/cent already multiplied by 100)
    currency_code: "NGN"
  });
  squadInstance.setup();
  squadInstance.open();

}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Initiate transaction


When the customer clicks on the **submit** button, initiate a transaction by passing the necessary details (email, amount, and any other parameters) to Squad through to a JavaScript function. 

```js
function SquadPay() {
 
  const squadInstance = new squad({
    onClose: () => console.log("Widget closed"),
    onLoad: () => console.log("Widget loaded successfully"),
    onSuccess: () => console.log(`Linked successfully`),
    key: "test_pk_sample-public-key-1",
    //Change key (test_pk_sample-public-key-1) to the key on your Squad Dashboard
    email: document.getElementById("email-address").value,
    amount: document.getElementById("amount").value * 100,
    //Enter amount in Naira or Dollar (Base value Kobo/cent already multiplied by 100)
    currency_code: "NGN"
  });
  squadInstance.setup();
  squadInstance.open();

}

```

A checkout modal will pop-up with different payment options for the customer to choose and input their payment information to complete the transaction. 

### Checkout Demo

<ApiTest />

### Key Information

1. The key field takes your Squad key.
2. By default, the amount field is already set in the lowest currency unit (kobo, cent). That is, to pay **NGN100**, you have to enter **10000** in the amount field.
To convert amount to the base currency (Naira, Dollar), multiply the amount parameter by 100 in your code, amount: document.getElementById("amount").value * 100, This will allow you enter the amount in Naira or Dollar as the case may be.

### Payment channels
After initialization, there are a couple of payment channels available to the customer to complete the transaction.

#### USSD
The USSD channel allows your Nigerian customers to pay you by dialing the USSD code on their mobile devices. Nigerian banks provide USSD services for customers to use for transactions, and we have integrated with some of these banks to allow your customers to complete payments.

After dialing the USSD code displayed, the system will prompt the user to input the USSD PIN to authenticate the transaction and then confirm it. All that is needed to initiate USSD payment is the customer's email and the amount to be charged. When the user makes a payment, the response will be sent to your webhook.

Therefore, to make it work as expected, webhooks must be configured on your [Squad dashboard](https://dashboard.squadco.com/login).

#### Card
With Squad, customers can pay with Card provided their card details are correct and updated.  The customer provides their card number, card expiry date, and CVV.

### How To Test

1. Create a free Squad [sandbox account](https://sandbox.squadco.com/login) and get your test keys from the dashboard.
2. Copy the code sample from the **Code Glossary** of this documentation unto a text editor of your choice.
3. Save the document as .html file. For example index.html 
4. With an internet-enabled device, view the .html file (index.html) using any web server of your choice either local (WAMP, XAMPP, etc) or online.

### Go live
To go live on the payment modal, simply change the test key to the live key found in your [Squad dashboard](https://dashboard.squadco.com/login).
