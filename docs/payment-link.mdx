### Creating a Payment Link

<Accordion 
    items={paymentLinkAPI} 
    parameters={true} 
    endpoint={"transaction/initiate"} 
    method={"POST"} 
    header={"This verifies a transaction"} 
    summary={"To verify the validity of a transaction, kindly query the endpoint above by replacing {{transaction_ref}} with the unique transaction_ref of the transaction you want to verify"}
/>

<AccordionCode items={paymentLinkResponse}/>

### Generating the Link
The payment link is a concatenation of the base URL: https://sandbox-pay.squadco.com/ and the hash selected when creating the payment link

For instance, if the hash is mypaymentlink then the payment link will be _https://sandbox-pay.squadco.com/mypaymentlink_

### GO LIVE - Production
To create payment link on production:

1. Kindly change the base URL of the endpoint from sandbox-api-d.squadco.com to api-d.squadco.com
2. Get production keys from your production environment on dashboard.squadco.com
3. On production, the base URL for concatenation of the payment link needs to be changed from sandbox-pay.checkout.squadco.com/hash to pay.checkout.squadco.co/hash
