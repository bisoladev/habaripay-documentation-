    method={"POST"} 
    header={"This verifies a transaction"} 
    summary={"To verify the validity of a transaction, kindly query the endpoint above by replacing {{transaction_ref}} with the unique transaction_ref of the transaction you want to verify"}
/>

<AccordionCode items={paymentLinkResponse}/>

#### Sample Request

```js
{
    "virtual_account_number": "3239145486",
