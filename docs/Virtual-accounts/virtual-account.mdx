Virtual accounts can be seen as another payment channel for your business since customers can now pay to the account number assigned to them. Whenever money is sent to the dedicated virtual account, you will get notified via your callback URL and an instant credit into your nominated bank account.

These events will be sent to your webhook URL so your servers can take action with respect to the payment on your system.
